        Hello! My name is Bryan Costa, and I am in a Coding Bootcamp looking to grow my knowledge in the field of web development. I currently work for Left Brain Logistics and being that our entire business is driven by technology and software, my boss felt the need to find someone who is able to develope applications in order to help us grow as a business. I showed interested in the field and my boss has since help me to go back to school to learn web development. Based on what I have learned so far in the class, I am already seeing different application to my job currently and I am looking forward to continuing to find ways to take what I am learning and use it to help the company grow.

        My friends and family tend to describe me as a laid back person who is willing to go with the flow. Over the years, I found that I tendency to be a good listener and someone whom people can come to when they need a person to vent to. This actually has helped me in my job, because as people have been venting to me I have been able to understand better what exactly the challenges that my coworkers are facing when it comes to technology and come up with better solutions that meet their specific needs. I find this particularly rewarding since it allows me to blend and use both my undergraduate education in Psychology and my current studies in web development.
